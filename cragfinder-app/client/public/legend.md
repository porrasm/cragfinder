## Boulder

**Name**: 4.5.10 Boulder (34600)  
**Definition**: An exceptionally large or otherwise notable rock boulder.  
**Selection criteria**: Over 2.5m tall or widely known, or a rock boulder that stands out distinctly from its surroundings in a sparsely rocky area. In areas with numerous rock boulders over 2.5 m tall, only the most distinctly distinguishable rock boulders are recorded.  
**Formation**: The rock boulder's center is recorded as a point.  
**Additional Note**: A protected rock is recorded as a NATURAL MONUMENT.

## Cliff

**Name**: 4.5.5 Cliff (34400)  
**Definition**: A steep rock slope or cut that forms a clear obstacle to passage.  
**Selection criteria**: Minimum dimensions: height 4m, slope 45 degrees, and length 10m. In exceptional cases, a cliff can be recorded as less than 4m tall, but not less than 2 m.  
**Formation**: The upper edge of the cliff is recorded as a line, with the cliff located on the right side of the line in the direction of recording. A rock cut is recorded as a cliff. A cliff cannot be a boundary line of a Terrain/1 area (there are objects in the database that are boundary lines of areas, these objects are not corrected as a separate measure).

## Crack

**Name**: 4.5.9 Rock Crack (34500)  
**Definition**: A narrow and long hollow or gorge in the rock.  
**Selection criteria**: Minimum dimensions: depth 3 m, length 100 m, and width 2 m. Rock cracks wider than 10 m are recorded as CONTOURS and/or CLIFFS.  
**Formation**: The line is recorded according to the deepest point of the crack.  
**Attribute information**: Information on the line's participation in the area partitioning is recorded. The line is generally not a boundary line of the area.
