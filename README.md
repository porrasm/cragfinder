## Tech

The tech is very simple and does not require explanation (NodeJS & React).

It is easily extended. The script `./data-parser/index.ts` can be used to extract `POINT`s or `LINESTRING`s from a GeoPackage. You can easily fetch a GeoPackage of your own area and generate your own resources. Then just fork this repository.
